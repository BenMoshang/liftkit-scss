# LiftKit CSS

LiftKit CSS is the vanilla CSS version of Chainlift's LiftKit design system. It's a lightweight framework of utility classes that use golden ratio scaling to provide a uniquely "oddly-satisfying" look. 




## Quickstart
I didn't expect to get literally hundreds of you to sign up within the first 2 days, so this is literally just the unedited exported code from the Webflow project. I need more time to clean it up into proper vanilla CSS. 

The CSS being rendered on `index.html` is under the `/css` folder. It relies on the Webflow dependencies and isn't recommended for use anywhere except for testing and tinkering.

The files in `/cssReference` simply contain the actual LiftKit utility classes grouped together into separate files for easier reading. 

This is messy, but it won't be forever.
## A Message from the Author

Hi everyone, 

I never imagined LiftKit would take off the way that it has. I thought it was going to be portfolio fodder, something I just put on job applications in the future to say "Hey, look what I did." 

To everyone volunteering to give it a try, thank you. I'm self-taught in everything I do, and I was starting to think I'd never be a "real" techie because of it. Even if this doesn't go anywhere, it's been incredibly validating to receive so much interest from the community. 

Best,

* **LiftKit is and will always be free.** I do not believe in gatekeeping knowledge, and I will never, ever, ever charge anybody for using it.

* **LiftKit is funded by Chainlift's project revenue.** If you need a design/dev partner, proceeds from your project fees will go towards further research and refinement of the LiftKit system. [Request a proposal here.](https://www.chainlift.io/request-proposal)

* **Anyone claiming to represent, work for, or be an "expert in" Chainlift or LiftKit is lying.** Chainlift is just me. Garrett. I'm the agency. It me.

* **I'm a git/github noob. Be patient.** Use 'Issues' to leave feedback, but you can also contact me directly at info@chainlift.io.
